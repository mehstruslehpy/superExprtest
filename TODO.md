- need to build list of broken arguments for analysis
- troubleshoot infinite loops
- need to work on more cleanly handling i-rules
- add special identity relation?
- write more testing tools
- write better testing tools
- add more test arguments from various logic books
- need to put more thought into quantifier handling in general current approach is somewhat arbitrary 
- need less randomization hopefully? (this might be unavoidable?)
- pretty sure the translator is not foolproof either based on randomized tests off the lisp wff gen scriptss
- long term: maybe add modal quantifiers?
- write a psuedocode representation of the proof loop 
- clean and refine expr library, too many comments, too much duplicate code, some other nastyness
- long term: remove heredoc/expect requirements

#NOTES:
- this is the working repository for a first order logic prover
- the prover is not foolproof, I have not had as much time as I would like to test it
- usually it seems to work okay
- basic operation is fine, i.e. it will successfully read an argument and attempt a proof usually the proofs and counterargs seem correct but sometimes things do not run as expected
- use at your own risk this is just a pet project for fun
